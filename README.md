### DeeplearningTF


1. Define the Problem <br>
    Clearly define the problem you want to solve. Determine whether it's a regression problem (predicting a continuous variable) or a classification problem (assigning an input to one of several classes).
2. Collect and Prepare the Data<br>
    Gather the data required for your task. Ensure the data is well-prepared, including cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values.
3. Define the Neural Network Architecture<br>
    Choose the architecture of your neural network, including the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the activation functions. This is often referred to as the model architecture.
4. Initialize Parameters<br>
    Initialize the weights and biases of the neural network. This is typically done randomly, and there are various initialization techniques.
5. Forward Propagation<br>
    Implement the forward propagation step, passing the input data through the network to compute the predicted output.
6. Compute Loss<br>
    Calculate the loss or cost, representing the difference between the predicted output and target values.
7. Backward Propagation (Backpropagation)<br>
    Implement the backward propagation algorithm to compute the gradients of the loss concerning the weights and biases. This involves calculating the partial derivatives of the loss concerning each parameter.
8. Update Parameters<br>
    Update the weights and biases using an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent. This step aims to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance.
9. Train the Model<br>
    Iterate through steps 5-8 for a specified number of epochs or until convergence. This process is known as training the model.
10. Evaluate the Model<br>
    Use a separate dataset (validation or test set) to evaluate the model's performance. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or others depending on the problem.
11. Tune Hyperparameters<br>
    Fine-tune hyperparameters, such as learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of neurons, etc., to optimize the model's performance.
12. Make Predictions<br>
    Once satisfied with the model's performance, use it to make predictions on new, unseen data.

#### Bias/Variance Trad-off

* We want our models to be good at adapting to different situations (low bias) but also not too sensitive or inconsistent (low variance). The trade-off is about finding that sweet spot where the model performs well on various tasks without making too many mistakes or being too rigid.

##### Process of diagnosing and addressing bias and variance issues in a model

1. Identifying Bias:
    * Check if the algorithm has a high bias by evaluating its performance on the training set.
    * If there is **high bias**, consider solutions like using a larger network, adding **more hidden layers**, training for a longer duration, or** exploring different network architectures**.
2. Reducing Bias:
    * Experiment with the mentioned solutions until the bias is reduced to an acceptable level, ensuring that the model can fit the training set well.
3. Evaluating Variance:
    * Assess variance issues by examining the model's performance on the development set.
    * If **high variance** is observed, consider **acquiring more data**, applying **regularization** techniques (**to reduce overfitting**), and exploring different network architectures.
4. Addressing Variance:
    * Getting more data is an effective way to tackle high variance, but it may not always be feasible.
    * Regularization and experimenting with different neural network architectures are additional strategies to reduce variance.
5. Balancing Bias and Variance:
    * Depending on whether the model exhibits high bias or high variance, the set of recommended actions may vary.
    * Modern deep learning, with the ability to train larger networks and access more data, has reduced the historical bias-variance tradeoff.
6. Benefits of Deep Learning:
    * In the deep learning era, having the tools to reduce bias or variance without significantly affecting the other has been advantageous.
    * Training a larger network is often beneficial, with the main drawback being increased computational time, as long as proper regularization is applied.
7. Regularization:
    * Regularization is a useful technique for reducing variance, with a slight mention of a potential increase in bias (though often not significant).
  
###### Let's talk about Regularization

    Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting, a common issue where a model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. The primary goal of regularization is to impose a penalty on the complexity of a model, discouraging it from fitting the training data too closely. The two common types of regularizations

    **L1 Regularization** (Lasso Regression)
    * Penalty Term: Introduces a penalty term proportional to the absolute values of the model parameters.
    * Effect: Encourages sparsity in the model, effectively pushing some parameters to exactly zero.
        Use: Useful when there is a belief that only a subset of features is relevant.
        
    **L2 Regularization** (Ridge Regression)
    * Penalty Term: Introduces a penalty term proportional to the square of the model parameters (Frobenius norm).
    * Effect: Discourages extreme parameter values and tends to spread the impact of all features.
        Use: Generally applicable and widely used; often helps prevent overfitting by keeping weights small.

    ##### Technics?

    1. Controlling Model Complexity:

        Regularization penalizes the model for being too complex, introducing a trade-off between fitting the training data and keeping the model simple.
    2. Shrinking Weights:
    
    By penalizing large weights, regularization encourages the model to assign smaller values to parameters, preventing them from becoming too specialized to the training data.
    3. Feature Selection (L1 Regularization):
    
    L1 regularization encourages sparsity, effectively leading to feature selection. Some features may have zero weights, making them irrelevant for the model.
    4. Balancing the Bias-Variance Tradeoff:
    
    Overfitting often results from high variance, where the model is too sensitive to fluctuations in the training data. Regularization helps strike a balance by controlling both bias and variance.
    5. Generalization to New Data:
    
    Regularization aims to improve the model's generalization performance by preventing it from memorizing noise in the training data.
