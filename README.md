1. Define the Problem <br>
    Clearly define the problem you want to solve. Determine whether it's a regression problem (predicting a continuous variable) or a classification problem (assigning an input to one of several classes).
2. Collect and Prepare the Data<br>
    Gather the data required for your task. Ensure that the data is well-prepared, including cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values.
3. Define the Neural Network Architecture<br>
    Choose the architecture of your neural network, including the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the activation functions. This is often referred to as the model architecture.
4. Initialize Parameters<br>
    Initialize the weights and biases of the neural network. This is typically done randomly, and there are various initialization techniques.
5. Forward Propagation<br>
    Implement the forward propagation step, where the input data is passed through the network to compute the predicted output.
6. Compute Loss<br>
    Calculate the loss or cost, which represents the difference between the predicted output and the actual target values.
7. Backward Propagation (Backpropagation)<br>
    Implement the backward propagation algorithm to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the weights and biases. This involves calculating the partial derivatives of the loss with respect to each parameter.
8. Update Parameters<br>
    Update the weights and biases using an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent. This step aims to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance.
9. Train the Model<br>
    Iterate through steps 5-8 for a specified number of epochs or until convergence. This process is known as training the model.
10. Evaluate the Model<br>
    Use a separate dataset (validation or test set) to evaluate the model's performance. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or others depending on the problem.
11. Tune Hyperparameters<br>
    Fine-tune hyperparameters, such as learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of neurons, etc., to optimize the model's performance.
12. Make Predictions<br>
    Once satisfied with the model's performance, use it to make predictions on new, unseen data.
