Orthogonalization in machine learning
    * Orthogonality refers to designing controls that affect only one aspect, making it easier to tune.
    * In machine learning, this involves identifying specific knobs to adjust for different issues. 
    * The four main considerations are training set performance, dev set performance, test set performance, and real-world application.
